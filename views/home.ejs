        <p>The 28-year-old, identified only as Sergej W, is accused of detonating three homemade bombs targeting the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund team on April 11, 2017.

            Dortmund defender Marc Bartra and a police officer were injured when three explosions hit the bus as it left a hotel in the city for a Champions League game against Monaco.

            The defendant, who gave evidence to a German court on Monday, claimed he had sought to fake the attack, and had designed the explosives so that "that no harm to people could be expected".</p>

        <p>Liverpool could be made to wait until the summer to spend more of the huge £142m fee they received for Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona.

            It is understood the Reds prime target is Monaco forward Thomas Lemar, but BBC Radio 5 Live are reporting that the France international is likely to delay any move to the Premier League because of this summer’s World Cup finals. But whenever the 22-year-old does move on, he will not come cheap.
            The Mirror claims Monaco will want at least £90m for Lemar, who is also a target for Arsenal.</p>
